channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults

dependencies:
# pypy is ~2X faster than the regular python interpreter.
# We need to install it first so the dependency solver installs it bundled with python 3.9
# (pypy is not yet compatible with 3.10 and 3.11)
# Do not install pypy by default, because Toil does not properly clean up filehandles, etc.
# See https://www.pypy.org/compat.html
